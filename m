Dear Friend  
 
I am interested in establishing and operating a very viable business as investment abroad. I do not know too well how this is done in your country, So I will need you to help me in this regard. My preference is any good profit business and I would appreciate any viable ideas you could come up with. I will also need you to help me look for properties like homes and lands for sale as I am proposing to invest the sum of ($55,000,000 USD) Million Dollars for this. I do not know if you can and will be of help to me or know someone that can handle this project for me and you will be compasated.

For brief on my personality; My name is DR.Martins Edward, a Moroccan based in London. I am a retired Business man formally into private Shipping Business. I am 68 years of age, I dropped my Shipping business because it wasn't producing profitable income. I have had so many problems with the British Authority just because I'm a foreigner I believe.
 
My need for this business proposition and to acquire these is very urgent. Please I expect your good and prompt reply so that we can proceed swiftly. I will need your phone numbers for easier communication with you if I am unable to access my emails.
 
You can always email me at ( dr.edward181@gmail.com ) Waiting your swift response
 
Best Regards,
DR.Martins Edward
