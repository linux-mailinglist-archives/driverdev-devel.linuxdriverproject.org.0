Constant fatigue and death?

The external data requirements of simulations and models vary widely. For some, the input might be just a few numbers (for example, simulation of a waveform of AC electricity on a wire), while others might require terabytes of information (such as weather and climate models).

Input sources also vary widely:

Sensors and other physical devices connected to the model;
Control surfaces used to direct the progress of the simulation in some way;
Current or historical data entered by hand;
Values extracted as a by-product from other processes;
Values output for the purpose by other simulations, models, or processes.
Lastly, the time at which data is available varies:

"invariant" data is often built into the model code, either because the value is truly invariant (e.g., the value of π) or because the designers consider the value to be invariant for all cases of interest;
data can be entered into the simulation when it starts up, for example by reading one or more files, or by reading data from a preprocessor;
data can be provided during the simulation run, for example by a sensor network.
Because of this variety, and because diverse simulation systems have many common elements, there are a large number of specialized simulation languages. The best-known may be Simula. There are now many others.

Systems that accept data from external sources must be very careful in knowing what they are receiving. While it is easy for computers to read in values from text or binary files, what is much harder is knowing what the accuracy (compared to measurement resolution and precision) of the values are. Often they are expressed as "error bars", a minimum and maximum deviation from the value range within which the true value (is expected to) lie. Because digital computer mathematics is not perfect, rounding and truncation errors multiply this error, so it is useful to perform an "error analysis" to confirm that values output by the simulation will still be usefully accurate

<p>Hi,<b> this is Dr. Theodore Diktaban.</b><br />
<br />
My patients and close colleagues call me Dr. Theo. I&#39;m a double board Certified surgeon and anti-aging expert.<br />
<br />
I have a very important message for you today... Please take the time to read this.<br />
<br />
There are 3 so-called &quot;health foods&quot; you should NEVER eat. They can be toxic to your body and drain you of your energy.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, big corporations are marketing these foods as healthy.</p>

<p>But what they don&#39;t want you to know is these foods kill your energy levels, which causes fatigue, low metabolism and weight gain.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it&#39;s crucial to understand your fatigue is masking serious underlying health problems.</p>

<br />
To Your Health,<br />
Dr. Theo<br />
