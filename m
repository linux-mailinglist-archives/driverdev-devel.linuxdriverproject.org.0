My Dear Beloved Friend,
Greetings, Please let this not sound strange to you because I am not
asking you for money, for my only surviving lawyer who would have done
this, died early this year. I
prayed and got your email address from your country's guest book which I
got from my late husband's archive and I wish to visit once more if God
will in his infinite mercies grant me. In function of your good profile, I
want to solicit your assistance in the discharge of my Will. I am mrs.
Jasmine Sebastian, from London and am aged 68 years suffering from
endometrial cancer. Please, I want you to help me create a charitable
project with the money that I inherited from my deceased husband who died
in a motor accident. I was brought up from a motherless baby's home and
was married to my late husband for twenty nine years without a child.

My friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness and I
cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any
of them anymore, so I sold all my inherited belongings and deposited all
the sum of 11,000,000.00 GBP (Eleven Million Pounds) with my bank. All I
need is an honest person who will use at least %60 of the funds as I would
instruct, then the rest %40 will go to you for helping me accomplish this
mission because donating this money to charity is the only legacy I can
leave behind after my death. No money is required from you to carry on
with this project because it is my heart desire to make a generous gift to
you to work for a charity in your country. I don't mind if you are a
Christian or Muslim or Hindu or Buddhist rather my only paramount concern
here is whether I can trust you because this generation is filled up with
greedy and fraudulent people all over the world. I will give you more
details as soon as I hear from you.

Please contact me on the below emails: jsebastine12@gmail.com
Looking forward to your urgent response.

Kind regards.
Mrs.Jasmine Sebastian
