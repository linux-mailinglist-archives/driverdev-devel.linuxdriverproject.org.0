Dear Sir/ Madam     

I, got your Email contact from the South Africa Exchange Information On-line Service on my personal programmed search on the internet for a reputable company or individual to assist me sincerely & confident that your information & profiles were very satisfactory and I decided to contact you immediately.        

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter. Within Eskom Holdings Limited where I work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation, I have in my possession an overdue payment in US currency.        

The said funds represent a certain percentage of the total contract value executed on behalf of my department by a foreign contracting firm, which I the official over-invoiced to the amount of US$350,000, 000.00 (Three hundred and fifty Million United States Dollar only). 

Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor leaving the excess balance unclaimed. Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relationships with foreign governments and non-government agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB).        

I am seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since I am not allowed to operate foreign accounts, Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of you/your Company. I have to propose that should you be willing to assist me in this transaction your share as compensation will be (30%), (5%) is for expenses and the balance of (65%) will be for me and my colleagues. 

The business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with Utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether you/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour of you/your Company. Also, your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.  

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.        

Thanks for your co-operation.   
    
Regards,    

Thabiso Nzimande     
Eskom Holdings SOC Limited
South Africa.
