My name is Reem E. Al-Hashimi, the Emirates Minister of State and Managing Director of United Arab Emirates (Dubai) World Expo 2020 Committee. I am writing you to stand as my partner to receive my share of gratification from foreign companies whom I helped during the bidding exercise towards the Dubai World Expo 2020 Committee.

Am a single Arab women and serving as a minister, there is a limit to my personal income and investment level and  For this reason, I cannot receive such a huge sum back to my country or my personal account, so an agreement was reached with the foreign companies to direct the gratifications to an open beneficiary account with a financial institution where it will be possible for me to instruct further transfer of the fund to a third party account for investment purpose which is the reason i contacted you to receive the fund as my partner for investment in your country.

The amount is valued at Euro 47,745,533.00 with a financial institution waiting my instruction for further transfer to a destination account as soon as I have your information indicating interest to receive and invest the fund, I will compensate you with 30% of the total amount and you will also get benefit from the investment.

If you can handle the fund in a good investment, get back to me for more details on this email; ( rahashimi80@gmail.com )

Regards,
Ms. Reem
