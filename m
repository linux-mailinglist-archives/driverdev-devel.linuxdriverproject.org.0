Season Greeting,

My name is Mr James Witherspoon, an Investment Attorney with a reputable
legal & investment management firm. My Firm mostly represents the interests
of wealthy investors.

Due to the sensitivity of the position they hold in their society and the
unstable investment environment of their country, some of our Clients
evacuate majority of their funds into more stable economies and developed
nations where they can get good yield for their money.

A Reserved Client, whom I had personally worked with a few years ago with a
proposal, recently approached me. What he request is an individual such as
you, who will be willing to receive money on his behalf, and put it to good
use for a period not exceeding 6 years for a start.

The Client has offered some terms which will be discussed when you show
interest and make appointment for meeting to know more and understanding,

Sincerely,
Mr James Whitherspoon
