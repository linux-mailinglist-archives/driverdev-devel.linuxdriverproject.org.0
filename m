From  Mr. Manuel Melchor 


Dear Sir,

 

BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY

 

I am Mr. Manuel Melchor, I lead a family investment vehicle who want to invest a proportion of their funds with a trust party. My client is a former Oil Minister in Angola, a politically exposed person who fell out with the current Government in that Country. 

 He is very eager to invest his funds out of  where it is currently  saved through a second party to ensure safety of his  hard earned money from the hands of his enemies and detractors that make up the current government in his country.

What we are looking for is a fund manager that has the capacity to handle investments in real Estate/Manufacturing etc. such a person can also suggest the area of business that he/she has strength in. We would like to know the investment climate in your country or wherever you intend to invest the money e.g. Government taxes, rebate for foreign investors coming in with huge amounts of money for investment. If you have the capacity to handle the investment we will sign a mutual cooperation agreement. The fund owner wants to invest the money he set aside for a period of 10 years subject to renewal.

Looking forward to your prompt and positive response.

 Best Regards,
Mr. Manuel Melchor
