Hello, 

I have good news for you.

I am Mr. Robert Nelson, a member of the Audit and Remittance Committee Snowmobile Corporation (UK). I need a silent foreign partner who I can trust to re-profile an outstanding contract fund and
transfer for lucrative investment and charity work. I will give you details of the deal as you respond promptly to this proposal. The funds shall be moved to your account  from our operating bank in
Europe, where it is currently deposited after proper documentations in your name as the beneficiary contractor of the fund.

The fund is valued at Ninety Five Million U.S Dollars ($95,000.000.00) I and my committee have made adequate arrangement with an insider in the admin of  Royal Court to facilitate documents that will
protect you as the beneficiary to receive the fund into your nominated account.

Choose the method you prefer to receive the Capital Investment Fund:


1. Bank to Bank Transfer
2. Online Banking Transfer
3. Bitcoin Wallet Transfer to your Bitcoin Wallet and to your Banking Account
4. Paypal transfer to your Paypal account and to your Bank Account.
5. Wire Transfer.


I will give you more details when you reply.
Regards,

Mr.Robert Nelson.
