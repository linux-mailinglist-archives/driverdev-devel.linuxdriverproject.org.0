Dear Esteemed Beneficiary,

This is to bring to your notice from the Executive Governor of the Central Bank Remittance Department that your outstanding contractual / inheritance payment which was suspended by the Nigerian government there by stopping the TRANSFER DEPARTMENT to pause the transfer of your contract fund to your nominated bank account. As a result of this development verification conducted by the Finance Ministry in conjunction with the Debt Verification Panel on your contract case file has been endorsed
for payment awaiting your confirmations.

In view of several efforts already made by us to contact you for the following reasons based on the new account submitted to this office on your behalf:

(1) My Office desks have just received a sworn affidavit from Mr.Jim Hermann  from your country to re-route your payment into a new bank account.

The sum of US$ 3.8 Million US Dollars ( THREE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND  US Dollars) 
(2) Please, confirm to our office if you have instructed Mr. Jim Hermann from your country to appoint an attorney/agent on your behalf thereby asking that he receive cash call remittance on your behalf.

(3) It have come to our notice that you are being contacted by unauthorized individuals with respect to your Contract / Inheritance payment but unfortunately this office is not aware of your unofficial dealings and warned that it is at your own risk.

(4) Please, also confirm if you have authorized Mr. Jim Hermann to change your banking particulars. Also re-confirm your details and, Private Telephone, your e-mail address,  so that we can cross-check it with our file records.

We have decided to contact you for re-verification because we suspected that Mr. Jim Hermann is trying to divert your money through the sworn affidavit into a new different bank account. You are advised to get back to this office within 7days from today.


Best Regards
Mr.Godwin Emefiele
Executive Governor Central Bank Nigeria
