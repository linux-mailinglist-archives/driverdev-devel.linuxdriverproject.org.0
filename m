This is to inform you of your long overdue Payment outstanding in our records. We saw your email address in our Central Computer unit among a list of unpaid inheritance claims individuals and have to update your information through this email contact for immediate confirmation. Your email appeared among the beneficiaries who will receive a part-payment of their overdue fund, Credited to the Online Bank ATM Card account that was set up for you and it has been approved already months ago.


However we received an email from one (Mrs. Elizabeth Juno) who told us That she is your next of kin and that you died in a car accident four months ago. She has also submitted her contact information to the office department for the delivery of your ATM Card to her as your inheritor. We are now verifying by contacting your email address as we have in our Bank records before we can make the delivery to her and for us to conclude confirmation if you are dead or not.


Please, confirm your response immediately to us before we release your ATM Card to her against your name listed out. Upon this, I request you send your full personal information as soon as possible to Atm Counsellor Office to enable them finalize with the delivery of your ATM Card to you.
