Dear Sir,

I live in the United Kingdom and I work in London, here is my 
Address:  Henwick Grove, Worcester WR2 6AJ, United Kingdom.

The most important reason why I contacted you is because of your 
Surname. I need someone with the same Surname as you to carry the 
project with me. Like I said in my previous mail I didn't come to 
you by chance or by accident, please treat this deal with utmost 
seriousness, secrecy and confidentiality that are associated with 
it. All that needs is for you to make a formal application for 
the release of the fund to you as the beneficiary to the trust 
fund. Of course I will guide and guard you on this.

Desmond A. Lee from Japan is dead whereby anyone with a surname 
as you can be presented to claim the funds as relative and next 
of kin. 

There is no risk whatsoever attached to Desmond A. Lee was an 
Investor, who has traded so much money in our bank and he has 
used our bank to transfer huge amounts of money from one country 
to the other doing business.

Like I said before, I have everything put in place for us to have 
a smooth and interrupted execution of this project and as soon as 
you provide to the bank with all the relevant documents that they 
will require from you which I shall provide to you, the funds 
shall be released and transferred to you. There is no other 
person involved in this deal, just you and me.

Please get back to me as soon as you have received and read this 
mail to tell me your mind so that I can give you details and more 
relevant information and the contact information of the bank and 
directives on how to go about executing this project.

Sincerely,

Mrs Shirley Hanna Bouroungs.
