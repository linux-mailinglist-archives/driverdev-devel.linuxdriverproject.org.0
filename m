Dear Sir,

We got your company information through an exhaustive search.

Our scope is basically to search for foreign companies to bid for contract supply on commission basis.

We are interested in buying your products in a larger quantity if only you can supply and open for business.

Best Regard,
Mr. Okrapah Adjei
CEO
OK-Adjei Sourcing Ltd
Accra,Ghana
