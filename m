Hello, Anice here, a financial funding expert and business 
financial specialist. I work with Frontera Capital Group, a 
boutique investment firm in the Middle East. We are led by a 
group of high-profile Middle Eastern investors eager to fund 
projects as they seek to expand their business portfolio 
internationally.

Frontera Capital is an international company providing a wide 
range of financial and consulting services for the private and 
public sectors worldwide. We offer long-term loans with flexible 
repayment terms for a maximum of 10 years. 

You can tap into this opportunity if you have any project you are 
currently undertaking that requires funding, or if you want to 
engage us in a more detailed discussion about our proposal, we'd 
be happy to do so in any medium that you prefer that is more 
appropriate for this engagement. I await your response for more 
details. 

God bless.

Anice Amrani,

Frontera Capital, Abu Dhabi

United Arab Emirate
