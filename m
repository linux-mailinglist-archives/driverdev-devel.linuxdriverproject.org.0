Dear Supporter 

RE: LETTER OF INTRODUCTION AND REQUEST FOR PARTNERSHIP/SUPPORT-THE COMPLETE STRUGGLE TO BRING HAPPINESS TO THE ORPHANS, LESS PRIVILEGED AND THE HELPLESS OLDER PEOPLE.

We are happily contacting you for this course because you are a kind-heartily fellow and a promoter of the welfare of the less privileged, here may not your focus site for charity or you may not have an interest in such as an individual, but I beg of you, rethink, we are all human-being and the people of this part of the world totally need your partnership/support.
Please read Matthew 25:42-46

The Asadu Amagu Humanitarian Foundation (AAHF) is a registered NGO and all government authorize operational approval documents are available for your perusal and/or verification, we start in early 2018 and our aim and objectives are to promote the well-being of the helpless/sick older people and for Godly upbringing of orphan children, less privileged and to fight against internet scammer and fraudsters and crimes in Sub-Saharan African and the world since our search proved beyond a reasonable doubt that bad government policies and abuses of public offices born crime.

Your partnership/support with AAHF stands a chance to save souls and make our world a better place for an inhabitant, AAHF, is not against any region/s we are against immoralities and crime. To make our world crime free, please party with AAHF.

An adage says! In every twelve (12) there must be Judas Iscariot, the betrayed Jesus and in every thirteen (13) there must be Jesus Christ the savior of the world, please do not think everybody in Nigeria, Africa is bad, many are good people, but unfortunately evil bad people are more because of hardship, please work with us to give the downtrodden a better life and save souls.
