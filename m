Dear  devel@linuxdriverproject.org, 

THIS IS FOR YOUR ATTENTION. 

I wish to notify you that you are the  beneficiary to the total 
sum of $10,600,000.00 Million (Ten Million Six Hundred Thousand 
United States Dollars). This is the sum deposited by my late 
client with the bank months before his eventual and unexpected 
dismiss. 

I am contacting you because you bear the surname identity and I 
can therefore present you as the beneficiary to the inheritance. 
I have no iota of doubt that you could receive these funds as you 
are qualified by your name identity. All the legal papers will be 
processed in your acceptance.

In your acceptance of this deal, we request that you kindly 
forward to us your letter of acceptance; your current telephone 
and fax numbers and a forwarding address to enable us file 
necessary documents at our high court probate division for the 
release of this sum of money. 



Yours Faithfully, 

Mr. Perry Edwards.
