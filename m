Dear Sir,
I have investor that want to invest $6.8 Billion into a  company that needs fund  for expansion only.He can not invest the money to new Companies that want to start up but into Companies that has been making good profits but needs funds for EXPANSION. 

His Area of concentrations are Real Estate, Biotech,Textiles , Information technology, Pharmaceuticals , Oil & Energy Industries, Mining &Metals Industry, Management Consulting Industry ,Maritime industry, Hospital & Health Care Industry, Consumer Services Industry, International Trade and Development Industry ,Gambling & Casinos Industry, Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing Industry, Insurance Industry, Chemical industries, Marketing and Advertising Industry, Leisure, Travel & Tourism Industry, Agriculture, Aviation, Retail, Import and Export, Trade and development industry, Real Estate & Construction Industry and any other viable investment opportunities just like yours.

If you recommend a Company to take loan or investment funds from from my client the investor, me and you will be entitled to 5% of any amount received by the Company from the investor but if you are taking the fund directly as a company i will be entitled to 2.5% and you will retain 2.5% as Global Finder's fee commission.
There will be a face to face meeting between the investor and the investee after signing (MOU) the (AORI) should not be less than 3% per annum.

Look for a reliable Company that need funding and we can easily make 5% of the amount received from the investor but we need to maintain absolute confidentiality in the transaction as the fund provider want to remain silent, so you have to keep it highly confidential between us.
I will need the company profile and the project summary of the company that will need funding to present to my investor.

I look forward to hearing from you.


Thanks
