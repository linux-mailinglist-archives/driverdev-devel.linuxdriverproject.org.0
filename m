Hello there, I hope receive this message in good spirits. I am 
Henry Ledwaba, a private investment broker with a Wealth 
Management compapny in South Africa. I am contacting you 
privately because one of my high profile clients is interested in 
investing investing a very substantial amount abroad and has 
asked me to look for individuals and companies with prospective 
business ideas that he can invest in. I got your email contact 
through an online business directory and I thought I'd contact 
you to see if you are interested in this opportunity. Do you or 
your company have new or existing projects that requires funding? 
If so, please indicate your interest by replying back to this 
email. Your response should include the executive summary of the 
projects, the amount of funding required for the projects and the 
expected ROI.

Once I get your response, we can go through the details of your 
projects to determine its viability and also make arrangements 
for securing the funding required to execute the projects.

Please also send your direct mobile/whatsapp numbers for an 
easier communication. Looking forward to your response.

Best Regards,

Henry.
