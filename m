Greetings and Sorry for intruding into your privacy.

My name is  Mrs Abiha Akten . I am a Cancer Patient and the disease have taken over my entire system according to medical diagnosis and I want to donate my inheritance fund ($32Million Dollars) that my late husband left with a financial house in Turkey to you because recently, the doctor told me that I might not survive the latest Surgery which I have been booked for.

I want you to use 30% of the fund to build orphanage homes while 20% goes to Cancer research programmes and then donate 25% to institutions housing elderly and retired persons who bore no children in their lifetime just like I and my late husband. The remaining 25% goes to you as the person who agreed to carry out my last wish and  I will give you more details only if you are willing and ready to handle this project. please reply me on this email mrsabiha.a@gmail.com thank you.

Yours Sincerely.
Mrs. Abiha Akten
