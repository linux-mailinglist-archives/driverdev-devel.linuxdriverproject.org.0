Hi Mark/Lee,

This patch series finish addressing support for Hikey 970
SPMI controller, PMIC and regulators.

I removed some unrelated DT patches from this series,
plus the Hikey 970 PHY USB3 code from it, in order to avoid
mixing different stuff on this series[1].

[1] Those unrelated patches were submitted last week on
separate series.

The entire patchset is on this branch:

	https://git.linuxtv.org/mchehab/experimental.git/log/?h=hikey970-destage-usb

In order to make easier for review, this series was generated
with --no-renames. So, you don't need to take a look at the
staging patches, as the entire code will be there on patches 9-11.

Patches 12 and 13 on this series will require that the other
patch series to get merged first. It probably makes sense to be
merged via DT tree. I opted to add them here just because,
on the last submission, you asked to see the DT patches. 

Regards,
Mauro

v3:
- fixed a bug with eco-mode at get_optimum_mode;
- changed the sleep logic when enabling/disabling a power line;
- additional cleanups, as requested by Mark;

v2:

- this driver's probe routine is very similar to the one at the non-SPMI
  variant of Hisilicon 6421;
- The register/voltage data were moved from DT into the driver itself;
- It doesn't have anymore any static data;
- All debug messages got removed;
- Addressed a few be32 warnings from sparse.
