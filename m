There's a DRC (Deposit Release Case) which is open in a Security and vaults company because the owner is now deceased and there's no clear next of kin to inherit the DRC valued at $10.3m.

As a financial consultant working with the  Security and Vaults company, I
propose that we work together to clear the DRC deposit.

This is totally 100% risk-free and would be mutually beneficial.

That's all the detail I can divulge for now until I receive your
positive reply and I can expatiate further.
Regards,
Mr. Alan Lambert
