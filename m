Hello,


I am Mr. Marwan Hadi, Head of Wealth Management, at HSBC Bank Dubai, UAE.  I have been in search of someone with the name  ''Hakuyo, so i came online in search of name or email that look like his, i think it is by the will of God to come across you now, i am having some important business discussion i wish to share with you, it is in connection with your email and you are going to benefit from it.

One Late Peter Hakuyo, a citizen of your country and a crude Oil dealer made a fixed deposit with my bank valued at US$70,000,000.00 (Seventy Million United State Dollars) the due date for the deposit contract was on the 17th of March 2020,sadly peter was among the death victims of covid-19 cases in China , My bank management is yet to know about his death, i knew about it because he was my friend and i am his account officer. Peter did not mention any Next of Kin/ Heir when the account was opened, so few months ago i was going through his account details and noticed that his account needs to be renew or to terminate the contract, so i thought of it again and again and i decided to get a next of Kin so that the fund can be out of HSBC Bank, now i am seeking for your co-operation so we can get the fund to our self instead of allowing it to remain in the bank and if the bank do not hear from Late Peter they will use the fund for their personal use, i have prayed and made a very
  good home grand work concerning this transaction before contacting you, since you have same last name with late Peter my bank head quarters will release the fund to you as the rightful next of Kin to the fund, there is no risk involved in this transaction all i want is for you to keep this transaction secret between the both of us, do not discuss with anybody about this transaction i am here to guide you all through this transaction, the fund will be transferred to your account.

I am not a greedy person, so I am suggesting we share the funds equal, 50/50% to both parties, my share will assist me to start my own company which has been my dream. Let me know your mind on this and please do treat this information as TOP SECRET. We shall go over the details once I receive your urgent response through my email address.

Email: marwanhadi090@gmail.com

Regards,
Marwan Hadi.

Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management, at HSBC Bank Dubai, UAE
