I will like to use this opportunity to wish you a productive time in 2021 a=
nd also confide in you to finalize this transaction of mutual benefits. It =
may seem strange to you, but it is real. This is a transaction that has no =
risk at all, due process shall be followed and it shall be carried out unde=
r the ambit of the financial laws. Being the Chief Financial Officer, BP Pl=
c. I want to trust and put in your care Eighteen Million British Pounds Ste=
rling, The funds were acquired from an over-invoiced payment from a past co=
ntract executed in one of my departments.

I can't successfully achieve this transaction without presenting you as for=
eign contractor who will provide a bank account to receive the funds.

Documentation for the claim of the funds will be legally processed and docu=
mented, so I will need your full cooperation on this matter for our mutual =
benefits. We will discuss details if you are interested to work with me to =
secure this funds. I will appreciate your prompt response in every bit of o=
ur communication. Stay Blessed and Stay Safe.
