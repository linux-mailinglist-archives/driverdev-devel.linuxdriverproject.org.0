Hello

How are you, I hope this email finds you in good health and spirit? Before I continue let me humbly apologize for coming into your space unsolicited. Nonetheless, I take solace in the fact that it is with the best intention and for our mutual benefit.

I chose you among other contacts I came across in my search for someone who can be of help.  It took a great deal of brain storming to arrive at my decision I must say, with the hope that my contact with you will be private and confidential.

The business idea that I have is to partner with you by investing in your country and you becoming my fund manager. This whole idea is borne out of the fact that presently I am totally indisposed to carry out any financial transaction owing to restrictions relating to the Russia /Ukraine war and the suspicious death of my husband, Ivan Pechorin in the hand of our President Vladimir Putin. 

It will be an absolute pleasure, if you would have the wherewithal to handle this project to my satisfaction. Every detail concerning this project would be laid bare to you upon indication of your interest. 

Pls. strictly send response to: dealings100@hotmail.com


Best regards

Anna Pechorin.
