Hello dear,

This is to notify you that after the last annual auditing, all unpaid claims have been resolved to be released in the next quarter hence we have determined that you are eligible to receive a reconciliation payment of $1.8m being your claims part payment as ordered by International monetary fund (IMF).

Following the discrepancies of all affected banks/companies to individuals globally in international payments, we have resolved to take over making sure all owed contract, inheritance, award and compensation debts are released which affected your claims but due to invalid account details/records, we were unable to credit your account. Please reconfirm your full name, sex, age and address and allow us 5-6 working days for your part payment to be processed and released to you through our accredited paying financial institution.

Contact below person:
Name: Lorenzo Bengat
EMAIL: lorenzobengat@aliyun.com

Thanks,
Dr. Zark Seidu
IMF
