I am Mr. MARK C. Joseph, Manager In charge of Foreign Remittance department of  ROYAL TRANSFER UNIT (RTU). The main reason for contacting you is to propose a business cooperation that will be of mutual benefit to both of us and requires absolute trust and total confidentiality. To get down to brass tacks, I want you to accommodate a large volume of funds worth (US$95.5 Million) which I want to transfer from an abandoned account to your personal bank account, It is 100% risk free.

If you are interested in this proposition, kindly respond back to me through
my email,(markjoseph4789@gmail.com) So I can give you further details and what is required for our trust, We will also negotiate an appropriate compensation for your efforts.

Yours faithfully

Mark
