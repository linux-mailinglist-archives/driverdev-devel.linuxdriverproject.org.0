Dear Supplier,

I am contacting you to take part in the ongoing rebuilding of our great
country Iraq, after many years of conflicts by supplying your products
here in Iraq.

We are determined to purchase your products in large quantities. A
consideration also is that your quotation must be CIF Port of Umm Qasr.

Get back to me with your products name and prices.

Regards,

Mazin Hussein
