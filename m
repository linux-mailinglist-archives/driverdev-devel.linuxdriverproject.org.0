Hello,

 I am the investment officer of an investment company who are ready to fund projects in the form of debt finance. The company grant loan to both corporate and private entities at a low interest rate of 3% ROI per annual. The terms are very flexible and interesting.

 Kindly revert back if you have projects that needs funding for further discussion and negotiation with any of the companies that will be interested to fund your project.

 Regards,

 Mark Johnson
