All state and non-state prostate, NGOs, financial companies, banks, security companies, and courier companies that have been in contact with you recently have been instructed to withdraw from your transaction and you have been advised NOT to respond to them since the International The Monetary Fund (IMF) is now directly responsible for your payment.
