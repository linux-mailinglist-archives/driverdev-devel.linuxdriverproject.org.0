Greeting,

I am indeed glad to be in contact with you even though this medium of communication (internet) has been grossly abused by criminal minded
people making it difficult for people with genuine intention to correspond and exchange views without skepticism.

In view of your outstanding profile and location,  I decided to write to you. I have decided that I seek your assistance in a matter that requires your urgent attention

I'm Abu Usman from Afghanistan, and I am contacting you due to the ongoing takeover by the Taliban in my country.

I need your urgent response to help me receive some funds for me.If this is something you can do, I will appreciate your early response, so that I can provide more and appropriate details of the entire proposal, given the fact that this is only a skeletal introduction.

I will appreciate if you could let me have the following information

1. Your Name
2. Address
3. Your cell Phone Number.
4. Occupation

Your positive response will be highly appreciated. As soon as I receive your response I will get back to you Asap.

Sincerely,

Abu Usman
