Hello dear,
 
We are in the market for your products after meeting at your stand during last expo.
 
Please kindly send us your latest catalog and price list so as to start a new project/order as promised during the exhibition. 
 
I would appreciate your response about the above details required so we can revert back to you asap.
 
Kind regards
 
Rhema Zoeh
