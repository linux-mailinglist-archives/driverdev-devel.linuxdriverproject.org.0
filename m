You might be interested to know that through so much correspondence, reports have reached our office of the uncomfortable way in which people like you are being treated by various banks and courier companies / diplomats across Europe to Africa and Asia / London UK.

All state and non-state prostate, NGOs, financial companies, banks, security companies, and courier companies that have been in contact with you recently have been instructed to withdraw from your transaction and you have been advised NOT to respond to them since the International The Monetary Fund (IMF) is now directly responsible for your payment.



Your name is on our payment schedule list of beneficiaries who will receive their funds in this first quarterly payment of the year, as we only transfer money twice a year, as per our banking regulations.
