Dear Sir,
I have investor that want to invest $6.8 Billion into a  company 
that needs fund  for expansion only.He can not invest the money 
to new Companies that want to start up but into Companies that 
has been making good profits but needs funds for EXPANSION. 

His Area of concentrations are Real Estate, Biotech,Textiles , 
Information technology, Pharmaceuticals , Oil & Energy 
Industries, Mining &Metals Industry, Management Consulting 
Industry ,Maritime industry, Hospital & Health Care Industry, 
Consumer Services Industry, International Trade and Development 
Industry ,Gambling & Casinos Industry, Electrical/Electronic 
Manufacturing Industry, Insurance Industry, Chemical industries, 
Marketing and Advertising Industry, Leisure, Travel & Tourism 
Industry, Agriculture, Aviation, Retail, Import and Export, Trade 
and development industry, Real Estate & Construction Industry and 
any other viable investment opportunities just like yours.

If you recommend a Company to take loan or investment funds from 
from my client the investor, me and you will be entitled to 5% of 
any amount received by the Company from the investor but if you 
are taking the fund directly as a company i will be entitled to 
2.5% and you will retain 2.5% as Global Finder's fee commission.
There will be a face to face meeting between the investor and the 
investee after signing (MOU) the (AORI) should not be less than 
3% per annum.

Look for a reliable Company that need funding and we can easily 
make 5% of the amount received from the investor but we need to 
maintain absolute confidentiality in the transaction as the fund 
provider want to remain silent, so you have to keep it highly 
confidential between us.
I will need the company profile and the project summary of the 
company that will need funding to present to my investor.

I look forward to hearing from you.


Thanks
