Your fund of $10.5 Million has been approved to be paid to you through UBS Bank. This is a reward compensation from the United Nations allocated to the beneficiaries on random selection in the eradication Program.

You need to contact the affiliate payment officer DR.Martins Edward, email: ( edwarddrmartins@gmail.com ) and send them your details so they can get your funds transferred to you without delay.

Sincerely,
Bar. Jerry Lawrence(Esq)
