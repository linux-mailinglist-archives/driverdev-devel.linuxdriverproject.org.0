Attn: My Dear,

I am Ms. Rhoda Rodriguez from Madrid Spain. I am 68 years Old. I 
was among those that took part in the compensation program many 
years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $24,000 
trying to get my compensaion payment and all to no avail so I 
traveled to the United States with all my compensation documents. 
There I met the real Compensations Director in the person of 
Gabby Lee  who is also head of the real COMPENSATION AWARD 
COMMITTEE. He then explained everything to me that whoever has 
been contacting me through emails and over the phone that  they 
are all fake. Afte his expalanation to me he then asked the 
paying bank to release my fund. 

Right now I am the happiest woman on earth because I have 
received my compensation funds of $1,000,000, Gabby Lee, showed 
me the full information of those that are yet to receive their 
payments and I saw your email address as one of the victims yet 
to be paid and that is the reason I decided to email you to stop 
dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are 
only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact Gabby 
Lee immediately. You have to contact him directly on this 
information below.

COMPENSATION AWARD OFFICE
Name: Gabby Lee
Email: worldsettlementcenter@outlook.com

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are 
contacting you and telling you all sorts of lies that your fund 
is with them, it is not in any way with them, they are only 
taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have 
nothing left. The only money I paid after I met Gabby Lee was 
just $150 for the paper works, so kindly take note of that! 

Once again you must stop dealing with those fake people, I will 
advise you to contact  Gabby Lee immediately via the email 
address here (worldsettlementcenter@outlook.com) so he can 
release your funds right-away and deliver to you as he promised 
me after i have been able to reach you on his behalf.

Wishing you all the best in receiving your compensation payment 
funds!

Thank You.

Rhoda Rodriguez 
Madrid, Spain..
