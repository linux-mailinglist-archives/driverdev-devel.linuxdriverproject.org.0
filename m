Government has three stages=E2=80=94first, when a Ministry is appointed; ne=

 exact use of the Queen at each of these stages, and how our present form o=

pleasure of Parliament. Mutatis mutandis, subject to the differences now to=
 be investigated, what goes on now would go on then. The Premier then, as n=

iament would then be the overt and single force in the selection of a succe=
ssor, whereas it is now the predominant though latent force. It will help t=
