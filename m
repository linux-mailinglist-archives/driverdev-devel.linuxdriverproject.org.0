Dear Sir,

We are an international refund structure. We are writing to 
inform you that our software has set up a detection system for 
all people who have been victims of internet scams.

As a result, we have detected that you are one of the victims of 
a scam, which is why we are contacting you to pass on the 
information so that we can reimburse you for all the money you 
have lost, as well as compensating you.

If you really are one of the people who has been scammed, please 
contact us so that we can check what you've lost and then we'll 
refund you.

NB: the refund structure offers this refund free of charge to 
victims of scams without paying us a penny.

Yours sincerely

Mrs.Edyta Jovichikj
