Dear Beneficiary, 

THIS IS FOR YOUR ATTENTION. 

I wish to notify you that you are the  beneficiary to the total sum of $10,600,000.00 Million (Ten Million Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). This is the sum deposited by my late client with the bank months before his eventual and unexpected dismise. 

I am contacting you because you bear the surname identity and I can therefore present you as the beneficiary to the inheritance. I have no iota of doubt that you could receive these funds as you are qualified by your name identity. All the legal papers will be processed in your acceptance.

In your acceptance of this deal, we request that you kindly forward to us your letter of acceptance; your current telephone and fax numbers and a forwarding address to enable us file necessary documents at our high court probate division for the release of this sum of money. 



Yours Faithfully, 

Mr. Perry Edwards.
