Good Day,

  Your payment files from three (3) different Banks, Nat-west Bank of London, Central Bank of Nigeria and Bank of America was compiled and submitted to my desk this morning for review. The total sum owed to you by the 3 Banks mentioned above was summed up to the tune of US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). The fund has been lodged in an Escrow account (non deductible) here in the Federal Reserve Bank New York.

 Having observed all due diligence required for the release of this fund to you, we ask that you reconfirm your mailing address. Upon receipt of this information, a certified cashier's check backed by this bank will be couriered to you for lodgment in any bank of your choosing.

 

Do not that we have a backlog of claims to process, claims are treated on a first come first serve basis. You are advised to act with dispatch.

 

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Mr. Jerome H. Powell

Federal Reserve Bank York, NY 10045
