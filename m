Dear Friend

 This is to thank you for your effort. I understand that your hands were
 tied. Not to worry. I have succeeded, the money has been transferred into the
 account provided by a newly found friend of mine in Nicaragua to compensate for
 your past assistance and commitments, I have dropped an international
 certified bank draft of $1.2M for your investments in life-settlement. I am
 in Nicaragua with my family presently. I do intend to establish some business
 concerns here, and possibly buy some properties. Now Contact my secretary Mr
 Will Clark  on his email willclark629@gmail.com phone 7052187354 Forward
 your mailing address/phone fax number to him, then ask him to send the
 cheque to you.
 
 Take good care of your self.
 Regards and respect,
 Pascal Simon
