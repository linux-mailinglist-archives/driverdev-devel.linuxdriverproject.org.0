Greetings Beloved Friend.
 
I'm sorry to interrupt your daily activities, I'm sending this message, please take a moment to read my email as it requires immediate and helpful response. I am Mrs. Monica Miriam Paul from the Kingdom of Bahrain, a widow to the late Dr. Steve Paul. l am 69 years old, suffering from long term cancer of the breast, from all indication my condition is really deteriorating and it is quite obvious that I might not live more than Six (6) months, according to my doctor because the cancer has gotten to a very worst / dangerous stage.
 
My late husband and my only child died last five years ago, his death was politically motivated. My late husband was a very rich and wealthy businessman who was running his Gold/Diamond Business here in the United States. After his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My doctors have advised me that I may not live for more than Six (6) months, so I now decided to divide the part of this wealth, to contribute to the development of the churches in Africa, Middle-East, America, Asia, and Europe. I collected your email address during my desperate search on the internet and I prayed over it and the spirit of our Lord Jesus directed me to you as an honest person who can assist me to fulfill my wish here on earth.
 
I decided to donate the sum of $15,600,000.00 USD (Fifteen Million Six hundred thousand United States dollars) to the less privileged because I cannot take this money to the grave. Please I want you to note that this fund is lodged in a bank here in the United States of America (USA).
 
Once I hear from you, I will forward to you all the information you will use to get this fund released from the bank here in the United States and to be transferred to your bank account. I honestly pray that this money when transferred to you will be used for the said purpose because l has come to find out that wealth acquisition without Christ is vanity. May the grace of our lord Jesus the love of God and the fellowship of God be with you and your family.
 
Kindly Send the below details to my private email: ( paulmonicamiriam@gmail.com ) to enable us to proceed.
 
1. Your Full Names:
2. Your Full Address:
3. Your Tel/cell Numbers:
4. Your Occupation:
 
God Bless you as I look forward to your positive response.
 
Mrs. Monica Miriam Paul
