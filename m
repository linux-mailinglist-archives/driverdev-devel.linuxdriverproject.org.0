I write to ask for your consent to carry out humanitarian 
projects and help the less privileged in this time of pandemic 
all over the world, I suffer from advanced cancer that prevents 
me from realizing my dreams. The doctor informed me that my days 
are numbered due to my degrading health. That's why I want to 
send you this sum of money ($4,000,000.00) Four million dollars 
so you can use it to help orphanages, the homeless and widows in 
this time this deathly virus (Covid 19) that is holding the world 
into ransom. 35% for you while you use 65% for the project, if 
you think you can give these poor children and the poor widow a 
glimpse of hope and joy, let me know by replying to my private 
email that is (christymccool1@gmail.com) Thank you for your 
cooperation and assistance.


CHRISTY MCCOOL
