Dear Sir, 

I am outsourcing individuals with proficient abilities to manage a vast wealth for an Arab Angel Investor with beleaguered political situation. These funds can be invested in tranches of 50M or a tranche that is suitable for the portfolio manager. 

If you have Investment and/or Portfolio Management abilities, credible projects in need of funding or existing businesses requiring expansion, we would be delighted to work with you. 

Sincerely, 

John
