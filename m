I am a bank manager here in   Cambodia and
one of my late customers who   has the same name as yours.
 He died 10 years ago and   left a huge amount of money   in his account.
Since then no relatives have   come to claim his money ..
I think we can work this out   together for mutual benefit ..

I will give you more details   on hearing from you soon.

Regards.
