 I'm Mr. Whyte Philip, a Director of International Investments at a private bank in London, UK. I am contacting you in regards to a deceased client who died while on holiday in Indonesia in December 25, 2015, I was his personal investment adviser and was responsible for all his transaction with our bank.


Before his death, my client has a deposit of 29,570.000.00 British pounds in his investments account with our bank and as you would know since he did not make any mention of a next of kin in the activation of the account, no one has been able to come forth to claim the deposit.

In the light of the above and as his investment manager for years, I know what is required to present you as the next of kin which will enable us claim the deposit, for this reason I am officially asking you, if you will like to partner with me in receiving this deposit claim because there is absolutely no one coming for this deposit.

I can personally guarantee that this will be swift and risk free and I am willing to partner with you in this terms, 60/40, mine will be 60 and you will be receiving 40 for your partnership.

Please get back to me with your acceptance message on my private Email: ( Whyte.Ph@gmx.com ) and also include your full names, address and direct phone numbers.

Thanks for your understanding and I will apreciate it if this content of this transaction is kept confidential.
Best regards,
Mr. Whyte Philip
