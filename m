Dear Friend,

How are you today?

I am using this opportunity to thank you for your great effort to our
unfinished transfer of fund into your account due to one reason or the
other best known to you.

But I want to inform you that I have successfully transferred the Cheque
out of the company to someone else who was capable of assisting me in
this great venture.

Due to your effort, sincerity, courage and trust worthiness you showed at
the course of the transaction I want to compensate you and show my
gratitude to you with the sum of 40,000.000.00(Forty Million United States
Of American Dollars) in respect to your lottery winnings Compensation.

I have authorised the finance house in the America where I deposited my money
to issue you international certified bank draft cashable at your bank.

My dear friend I will like you to contact the finance house for the
collection of this international certified bank draft. The name and
contact address of the Person with your Cheque is as follows.

CONTACT AGENT: Barr. Jovanny Anderson
EMAIL: jovannyanderson001@gmail.com

At the moment, I am very busy in Japan because of the investment projects
which I and my new partner are having at hand.

Finally, remember that I have forwarded instruction to the finance house
on your behalf to send the bank draft to you as soon as you contact them
without delay.

Thanks and God bless you and your family. Hope to hear from you soon.

Best Regards,
Dr. Ericsson Davies
Controller General
