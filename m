My Beloved Good day,

May the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be unto you. I am Mrs. Chioma Grace Allen from Nigeria but lives in London. a widow to late Dr. A. Allen. I am 58 years old and a converted born again Christian, suffering from long term cancer of the breast, from all indication my condition is really deteriorating and it is quite obvious that I might not live more than two (2)months, according to my personal doctor because the cancer has gotten
to a dangerous stage.

My late husband and my only child died last five years ago, his death was politically motivated. My late husband was a very rich and wealthy business man who was running his Gold/Diamond Business in Ghana. After his death, I inherited all his business and wealth, so I now decided to divide the part of this wealth, to contribute to the development of the charitable organization in Africa, America, Asia, and Europe. I collected your email address during my desperate search on the internet and I prayed over it and the spirit of our Lord Jesus directed me to you as an honest person who can assist me to fulfill my wish here on earth.

I decided to donate the sum of US$30 million (Thirty Million United States Dollars) to the poor, less privilege, orphanage home and motherless because I cannot take this money to the grave. Please I want you to note that this fund is safe & secured in a bank. Note that after the successful completion of this transaction,you and the Orphanage Homes will have a fair share of the fund in the ratio of 50:50.If you AGREE with my conditions, l advise you on what to do immediately and the transfer will commence without delay as I will proceed to fix your name on the Payment schedule instantly.

I want you to fill and forward the below to me. Meanwhile you can contact my Lawyer Barrister Bello Ahmed Ali on his cell phone +2348143096683.

1. Your Full Name:..
2. Current Address:.
3. Direct Phone:....
Cell Number:........
4 Occupations:.....
5. Age:..........
6. Company:.......
7.Email ID.........

I hope you don't reject this offer and have this funds transferred. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the fellowship of the holy spirit be with you and your family.

Waiting for your reply.

Yours faithfully,
MRS. CHIOMA GRACE ALLEN.
