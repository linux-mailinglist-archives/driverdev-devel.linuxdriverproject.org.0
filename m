Good day
     
My name is Yildiz Oguzhan, a Board Member of ILBANK of Turkey.
     
A late investor of our bank died and left $13, 500,000.00 Million dollars in our bank some years ago and there was no any next of kin to claim this fund.
     
Please get back to me as soon as possible for more details if you are interested in my proposal.
     
     
Best Regards
     
Yildiz Oguzhan
