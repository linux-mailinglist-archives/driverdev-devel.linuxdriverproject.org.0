Good morning,

        Our Company Chief Operating Officer (CEO) in Ghana, is interested in the importation of VAPORIZED AGRICULTURAL SPRAY OIL VESO-1000 in large quantities. Can you supply the product? VAPORIZED AGRICULTURAL SPRAY OIL VESO-1000 is used in the production of animal drugs, vaccine and food supplements for Sub-Saharan Horses and Ponies and it is newly formulated in your country, the price of the product is twice as cheap as what our company buys in the United States of America.

    I am specifically contacting you so that you can bridge the gap between the local source and our company and act as a purchase agent while you supply the product directly, after we share the over invoice excess profit together. That is my interest.

    Your urgent response will discourage me from further search. Contact me now if you are interested for more details with your phone number.

Thank


Mr. Robert Patrick Ankobiah
Ag. Chief Director
