crept in: Who neglected that post?  After the ship has got on the rocks, it=
 is made known to the horrified passengers that there are no ship's lifeboa=
ts aboard, neither are there any lifebelts: Whose blame is that?  Still the=
re seems hope, for the shore is not far off, and anxious people line it; bu=
t no ordinary boat can live in such a sea.  There is no rocket apparatus on=
 this part of the coast; no mortar apparatus by which a line might be sent =
on board: Why not?  The nearest lifeboat station is fifteen miles off: Whos=
e fault is that?  Is the storm our enemy here?  Is not selfish, calculating=
, miserly man his own enemy in this case?  So

returned Bax, with an approving nod; that's just the point which I'd like y=
ou and me to stick to: when we see things to be wrong don't let's shirk say=
in' so as flat as we can; but don't let us go, like too many shallowpates, =
and say that we know _who's_ wrong and _why_ they're wrong, and offer to pu=
t them all right on the shortest notice.  Mayhap (here Bax spoke in a soft =
meditative tone, as if he had forgotten his young friend, and were only thi=
nking aloud) mayhap we may come to understand the matter one of these days,=
 and have a better right to speak outwho knows? That I'm certain of cried T=
ommy, in a tone and with an air that made Bax smile despite the sad sight b=
efore him. Come, lad, he said, with sudden energy, we must get 'em removed.=
