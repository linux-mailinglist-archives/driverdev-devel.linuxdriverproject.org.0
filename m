Peace Be Unto You

I am Ichwan Raden Mas, the project Engineer with Al Shafar General Contracting (ASGC) a Construction Company here in Abu Dhabi U.A.E, 
some  years back my organization awarded contracts to some foreign firms and this contract was over inflated over a period
 of years to the tune of eight million  five hundred thousand America dollars in order for me to benefit from this contract.
  However the original contractors have been paid their contract sum and the accrued balance which is eight million five hundred thousand America dollars 
have been lying in a suspense account in one of the Bank in awaiting remittance.

I wish to have a deal with you as regards to this unpaid fund as all datas are correct and it is my duty to recommend the transfer of these funds to the company's contract
 review board therefore I use this opportunity to write you based on the instructions received three days ago from the to submit the list of payment the company's 
reports/expenditures and audited reports of revenues before the end of next week.

If you AGREE with my offer, I want you to send to me now your

FULL NAME:
FULL ADDRESS :
and a DIRECT TELEPHONE NUMBER:

and this business will commence without delay as I will proceed to fix your name on the payment list instantly for approval before the end of next week.

I hope you do not reject this offer as I await your reply soon.

Thank You

Ichwan Raden Mas
