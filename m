For your kind Attention:

Permit me to introduce myself, I am Mr. Ulan Vadim a personal Representative of: Mrs. Elena Aleksandrovna Georgieva from Russia who has instructed me to source a reliable individual that receives her funds for investment since they stand the chance of losing their investment in most parts of Europe especially with the recent sanction by the United States /British Government due to the Russian government's attack on Ukraine. 

We urgently need a serious and reliable investor that can receive USD$100m urgently. Get back to me if you are interested as my client is ready to offer 20% to be shared between you, me and the bank officer who will facilitate the payment.

Sincerely 
Mr. Ulan Vadim
