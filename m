It could, but it shouldn't.

It may be both voltage and frequency - but in some cases only voltage.
From HW point of view, many ARM legacy platforms have power domains
that work like this.

As you know, the DVFS case has in many years not been solved in a
generic way, but mostly via platform specific hacks.

The worst ones are probably those hacking clock drivers (which myself
also have contributed to). Have a look at clk_prcmu_opp_prepare(), for
example, which is used by the UX500 platform. Another option has been
to use the devfreq framework, but it has limitations in regards to
this too.

That said, I am hoping that people start moving towards the
deploying/implementing DVFS through the power-domain approach,
together with the OPPs. Maybe there are still some pieces missing from
an infrastructure point of view, but that should become more evident
as more starts using it.

In my view, DT bindings have consistently been pushed back during the
year, if they have tried to model power domains as regulator supplies
from consumer device nodes. Hence, people have tried other things, as
I mentioned above.

I definitely agree that we need to update some documentations,
explaining things more exactly. Additionally, it seems like a talk at
some conferences should make sense, as a way to spread the word.

Kind regards
