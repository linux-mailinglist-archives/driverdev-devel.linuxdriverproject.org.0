Please kindly allow me share this information with you.

Dear Beloved,
Life is gradually passing away from me as a result of my present medic=
al condition and my personal doctor confided in me that I have only bu=
t few more weeks to live.
In view of this setback, I=A0want to donate my estate for humanitarian=
 assistance, since this has always been the plan of my late husband an=
d besides I have no child.
In an effort to compliment the good work of our creator for humanity a=
nd the wish of my late Husband I donate the sum of =8010,000,000.00 Eu=
ro (Ten Million EUR) to you to stand as my project director for this c=
harity purpose.
On your acknowledgment of this mail and informing me of your nationali=
ty and current place of resident, my Bank will facilitate due processe=
s for transfer of this legacy to you.May God bless you as you use this=
 money judiciously for the work of charity.
Sincere regards,

Ms. Melvida Bullock
