Hello
As you may have noticed, I sent you an email from your email account devel@linuxdriverproject.org 
This means that I have full access to your account
I have been watching you for a few months
The problem is that you were infected with njrat through an adult website that you visited
If you don't know about this, let me explain
njrat gives me full access and control over your device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you don't know
I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.
On the left half of the screen, I made a video showing how you pleasured yourself, on the right half you see the video that you watched.
With a click of the mouse I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks
I can also see access to all your communication and messaging programs that you use.
If you want to avoid this,
Transfer the amount of 1200 USD to my bitcoin address write moonpay or banxa or go to p2p exchange if you don't know
My Bitcoin address (BTC wallet): 1J9mGro5tqDNje8qKnLJ36a5vj2Wh2bv1J 
After the payment is received, I will delete the video and you will not hear from me again
I am giving you 48 hours to pay
Don't forget that I will see you when I open the message, the counter will start
If I notice that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be posted immediately
