I Tammy Webster and my husband Cliff Webster won $ 316.3 million in the Powerball jackpot and we decided to help those in need. We decided to donate a total of $ 100 million to help those affected in one way or another. Due to the crisis and the pandemic in Europe, we decided to donate $ 3 million each to 33 lucky people in our charity project.

To check out our lottery winnings, check out my interview below:
