Peace be unto you

How are you? I am Mrs. Dolores D.Raymond an ageing widow 
suffering from blood cancer,I am now confined to a nursing home. 
I have some inherited funds from my late loving husband, the late 
Mr. Michael Raymond, The amount of [$5.200,000.00] five million 
two hundred thousand dollars which he deposited with the Bank and 
I need a good honest God fearing person who will use these funds 
for God's work in charity. I want this fund to go for charity 
work because I have no child to inherit the fund, 15% out of the 
total fund will be for your compensation for doing this work of 
God. Please if you would be willing to carry out the project to 
the glory of God kindly reply to me .for more information thanks 
and God bless you.

Yours Sincerely,


Mrs.Dolores D.Raymond.
