I am Mr. Lukman Mohammed Nagogo and I give permanent special assistance to the late Chief of Staff Abba Kyari. The truth is that on a trip I took with my boss to London, United Kingdom, my boss used my name and deposited Money in London, the name of the bank is currently omitted for security reasons. Only my boss and I know about this warehouse.

The funds were originally meant to sustain the Diaspora citizens that are stranded overseas, however, I intentionally kept silent to know if the National Commission for Diaspora citizens may inquire about the fund and fortunately they have not. Therefore, I have decided that the fund will be lying idle in the bank instead, so, it is good to look for a responsible foreign partner with whom I will sign an investment agreement and release the fund to him for investment purposes in their country.

I made this decision because, as a public official, I cannot invest this fund in my country and if I do, the current government will ask me about the origin of the fund, hence I am looking for a reliable partner abroad.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Lukman Mohammed Nagogo
