Dearest Beloved,

I am Fabio Antonio, A Portuguese national, I was browsing and I saw your email, So i decided to write to you if your email is real, I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now I have only about a few months to live. I am very rich, but was never generous; I have given most of my assets to my immediate family members.

I have decided to give alms to charity organizations. I cannot do this myself anymore because of my health. I once asked members of my family to give some money to charity organizations, they refused and kept the money. I have a huge cash deposit of Eighteen Million dollars with a security firm in America. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations. You will take out 30% of these funds for your assistance.

I will like you to acknowledge the receipt of this e-mail as soon as possible and treat it with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.

Fabio Antonio
