Dear Beloved,



Life is gradually passing away from me as a result of my present medical condition and my personal doctor confided in me yesterday that I have only a few more weeks to live. In view of this setback, I want to donate my estate for humanitarian assistance, since this has always been the plan of my late husband and besides I have no child. In an effort to compliment the good work of our creator for humanity and the wish of my late Husband I donate the sum of 10,000,000.00 Euro (Ten Million EUR) to you. Upon your acknowledgement of this mail and informing me of your nationality and current place of resident, my Bank will facilitate due processes for transfer of this legacy to you. May God bless you as you use this money judiciously for the work of charity to help the less privileged.



Sincere regards,



Ms. Melvida Bullock
