?I write to ask for your consent to carry out humanitarian projects and help the less privileged in this time of pandemic all over the world, I suffer from advanced cancer that prevents me from realizing my dreams. The doctor informed me that my days are numbered due to my degrading health. That's why I want to send you this sum of money ($4,000,000.00) Four million dollars so you can use it to help orphanages, the homeless and widows in this time this deathly virus (Covid 19) that is holding the world into ransom. 35% for you while you use 65% for the project, if you think you can give these poor children and the poor widow a glimpse of hope and joy, let me know by replying to my private email that is (christymccool12@outlook.com) Thank you for your cooperation and assistance.


CHRISTY MCCOOL
