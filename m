Harts-field-Jackson International Airport
6000 N Terminal Pkwy,
Atlanta, Georgia.30320, USA

Hello,

I am James Witherspoon Head of Customs Inspection Unit in Harts field-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered An abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from the United Kingdom which was transferred from JFK Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each. The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as a personal Effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities.

The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more. They are still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 110kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective Capacity: 680 L) Approximately. 

Like I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. 

I am ready to make a deal with you on how you can claim the box without any hitches.On this note we will discuss on the share formula.  I will be fully involved by doing everything that will make the consignhnment to leave to your destination.Also, I will like you to promise that you will receive the consighment and kept it secret untill I come to your country and we will do the needful.
Please Reply with reconfirmation of your Full Name, Home Address, City, State and Telephone number.

Sincerely,

James Witherspoon,
Head Officer-in-Charge
