Dear Sir,

I am from a UK Based Investment Group. We are expanding our global presence by investing in viable projects across the globe. We will be willing to inject from $3,000,000 to $250 million and more in a viable project(s)

We grant our funding at a 3% ROI per annum for 10 years and 12 months moratorium. If you have a viable project that needs funding, kindly revert back with your business plan and executive summary for our review and possible funding. Reply to my private email as stated: doreenphilips@yandex.com

Sincerely Yours,


Mrs. Doreen Philips.
Client Executive.
