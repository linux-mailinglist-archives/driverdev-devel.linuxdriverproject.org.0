Hello Dear,

I am Klen Tindle by name, from America and working with the USA
military still on a mission in Afghanistan. I really need your
assistance that is the reason why I contacted you, I want to go
into a cordial relationship and business partnership with you, as
I don't know how long we would stay in the war zone here, Here in
the military zone we are not allowed to make use of mobile
phones, we only make use of radio message and e-mail
communication.

I want you to know that we are being attacked by insurgents every
day and several bombings. During one of our rescue mission we
came across a safe box that contain huge amount of money that
belongs to the revolutionaries, which I believe they use in
buying weapons and ammunition and it was agreed by all parties
present that the money will be shared among us.

Out of the total fund my share was $5,000,000 (Five Million US
Dollars), I am seeking your assistance to evacuate my share of
the money, which is $5,000,000. out of here to you; in as much as
you can assure me that my own share will be safe in your care
until I complete my service here, This is not stolen money, and
there are no dangers involved.

I have made arrangements with a United Nation Diplomat who
promised to deliver the fund to any of my chosen destination, I
shall be compensating you with 30% of the total fund if you can
help me secure the box, while the balance shall be my investment
capital in your country, One passionate appeal I will make to you
is not to discuss this matter to a third party, if you have
reasons to reject this offer, please destroy this e-mail as any
leakage of this information will be too bad for me, due to my
position as a USAF Lieutenant.

I have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that
you will not betray my trust, but rather take me as your own
sister, Though you may wonder why I am so soon revealing myself
to you without knowing you, well I will say that my mind
convinced me that you are the true person to help me receive and
invest the fund.

I do not know how long we will remain here, and I have survived
two bomb attacks here, which prompted me to search out for a
reliable and trustworthy person to help me receive and invest the
fund in his country.

I wish you send me a reply immediately as soon as you receive
this proposal, Your urgent reply will be highly appreciated. I
hope my explanation is very clear but if you need further
clarification, then send your questions, I wait to hear from you
soonest.

Regards,
USAF Lieutenant Kaylen Tindle.
