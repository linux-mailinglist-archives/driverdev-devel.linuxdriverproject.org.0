Dear Friend

My name is Usman Ahmed, A banker by Profession at (National Bank of Bahrain in the United Arab Emirates) also a relationship account officer to Mr. Burhan. I got 
your email in my search for a reputable and reliable person to help me claim the sum of USD14,700,000.00, Deposited in our Bank by one of our customers Mr. Burhan 
died of a heart attack at the Riyadh Hospital in Saudi Arabia.

Since his death no one has come up as his next of kin and all our efforts to locate any member of his immediate family has proven abortive. That was why I decided 
tosee if I can get anybody via the Internet to help me claim this fund, which I believe you have all the qualities. The reason I'm contacting you is to present you to our 
bank as the next of Kin to the deceased customer since you both have a common name.

It will interest you to know that I have been keeping the account dormant to enable my plans for the funds to come through and this is the time and I'm happy to 
locate you for the perfection of the transfer of the Fund into your nominated Bank Account. I have done enough work in the banking system and all I have to do is
enter your details into the information network on the banking computer and you have to be mirrored as your closest relative.

On smooth completion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 50% of the total sum as gratification, while 50% will be for me. If you are interested, I can provide 
further details of the transaction. I also have an intention of investing my own percentage of the money in any profitable investment in your country, do you have a 
better idea for any lucrative business?

Looking forward to your urgent response through my personal email address (mrusmanahmed91@gmail.com) and also by updating me with your direct telephone 
number for easy communication.

Yours Specially,
Mr. Usman Ahmed
