I am Wally Adeyemo, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. Further details about me can be found on the official treasury website or via the link below;

https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/Wally-Adeyemo

We understand that the COVID-19 public health crisis and resulting economic crisis have created a variety of challenges for individuals, small, micro and solo businesses around the world amidst the new variant. The Treasury Department is providing critical assistance to selected individuals across the globe, facilitating the urgent deployment of capital and support to help individuals and small businesses not just persevere, but recover on solid footing in these difficult times.

The US Treasury have directed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to expedite the payment of all outstanding compensation/inheritance/pandemic relief funds owed to individuals and small businesses from previous years and be sure that all funds are paid to befitting beneficiaries this fiscal year 2022.

As a result of this development, you have been selected alongside a few other beneficiaries to receive a payment of $1,250,000 (One Million Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars only). 

In lieu of this, you are required to furnish me with your personal details as requested below to enable us process your payment;

(1) Full Names:
(2) Residential Address:
(3) Date of Birth:
(4) Phone/Cell Number:
(5) Occupation:

More so, it's my concern to demand your ultimate honesty and cooperation to enable us expedite this transaction. It is guaranteed that this process would be executed under a legitimate arrangement that would legally protect you from any breach of Law.

Get back to me as soon as you can.
