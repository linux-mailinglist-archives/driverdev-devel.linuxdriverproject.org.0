Hello there,

I am Laghouili Abdellatif. I am contacting you because I have a proposal that I think may be interested in. I represent the interest of my brother in-law who was a minister in the Syrian Government. As you probably know, there is a lot of crisis going on currently in Syria and my brother in-law has fallen out with the ruling Junta and the president because of his foreign policies and the senseless war and killings that has been going on for a while. Everybody in Syria is fed up and want a change but the president is too powerfull and he simply kills anyone that tries to oppose him. My brother in-law belives that he is at risk and he is now very scared for the safety of his family especially his kids. In order to ensure that his family is taken care of and protected incase anything happens to him, he has asked me to help him find a foreign investor who can help him accommodate and invest 100 MUSD privately that he has secured in Europe. He wants these funds safely invested so
that the future and safety of his

I am contacting you with the hope that you will be interested in helping us. We need your help to accommodate the funds in the banking system in your country and also invest it in a lucrative projects that will yeild good profits. We will handle all the logistics involved in the movement of the funds to you. The funds is already in Europe so you have nothing to worry about because this transaction will be executed in a legal way. My brother in-law has also promised to compensate you for your help. He wants this to be done discretely so I will be acting as his eyes and ears during the course of this transaction.

If this proposal interests you, please kindly respond so that I can give you more details.

Regards,

Laghouili.
