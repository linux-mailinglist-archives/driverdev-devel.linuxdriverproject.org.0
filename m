Attn: Dearest.

I'm Mrs. Judith Peters a Successful business Woman dealing with Exportation, I got your mail contact through search to let you know my Ugly Situation Am a dying Woman here in Los Angeles California Hospital Bed in (USA), I Lost my Husband and my only Daughter for Covid-19 I'm dying with the same symptoms and more.

My Doctor open-up to me that he is Afraid to tell me my Condition and inside me, I already know that I'm not going to survive and I can't live alone without my Family on Earth, I have a project that I am about to hand over to you. And I already instructed the Heritage Bank to transfer my fund sum of $5,500,000.00 (Five Million and Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) to you as to enable you to give 50% to Charitable Home and take 50% for yourself.

Don't think otherwise and why would anybody send someone you barely know to help you deliver a message, help me do this for the happiness of my soul and for God to mercy me and my Family and give us a good place.

Please, do as I said there was someone from your State that I deeply love so very much and I miss her so badly I have no means to reach any Charitable Home there, that is why I go for a personal search of the Country and State and I got your mail contact through search to let you know my Bitterness and the situation that i am passing through.

Please help me. I am getting Dark. I ask my Attorney to help me keep you notice failure for me to reach you in person.

The Doctor said I have a few days to live, please contact my attorney with the following email address and phone number as soon as possible, I am finding it difficult to breathe now and I am not sure if I can stay up to 24 hours, please contact my attorney through his email below.

Name Attorney George Walter.
Email:attorneygeorgewalter@aliyun.com

Please hurry up to contact my attorney so that he can direct you on how you will hand over 50% of the $5,500,000.00 to Charity, i really want to achieve that goal by helping the Charity organization before I die.

My Regards.
Mrs. Judith Peters.
