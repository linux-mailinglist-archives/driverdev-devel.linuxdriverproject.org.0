Salam alaikum,

I am the investment officer of UAE based investment company who 
are ready to fund projects outside UAE, in the form of debt 
finance. We grant loan to both Corporate and private entities at 
a low interest rate of 2% ROI per annum. The terms are very 
flexible and interesting.Kindly revert back if you have projects 
that needs funding for further discussion and negotiation.

Thanks

investment officer.
