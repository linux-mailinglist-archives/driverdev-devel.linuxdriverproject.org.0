Good Day My Dear Beloved,


I am sorry not to get back to you in time. I was on special assignment
in Vatican City (Rome) Just returned last week.


I am Reverend Sister Margaret Johnson, from =A0St. John's Cathedral
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, it's very pathetic that we lost Rev.
Father Gerard Andrew of St. John's Cathedral Kuala Lumpur. Late
Rev. Father Gerard Andrew was an American and also an orphan but
nationalized in St. John's Cathedral Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.


He died on April 13, 2022 =A0and before he died, he made a will and
instructs me to contact you on your email when he died as the next of
kin of his fund as his spirit directed him and made you the
beneficiary of his will a sum of $5,500,000.00 through your e-mail
address which he choose after a random sampling of many
people's e-mail addresses by the help of Microsoft international firm.


Now for you to claim your fund, forward your details below via this (revere=
ndsistermargarethjohnson@gmail.com)to me so I can forward it to the CIMB BA=
NK
MALAYSIA for the release of your funds.


Full name.
Contact address.
Age
Occupation.
Private phone number.
Driver License


Attached is the Deposited Certificate on your behalf.

Congratulations Looking forward to be reading from you.


Best regards & God bless you.
Reverend Sister Margaret Johnson.
