Good morning,

     Concerning the previous email I sent to you, could you kindly indicates if you will be able to sale the products to my Director directly as proposed. I am still waiting for your response if you did not received it I can resend it to you again.
  Alternatively, could you kindly leave your Phone/Whatsapp number for urgent communication.

Please reply is urgent for business. 

Thanks,

Yours faithfully,




John Apiah.
