I am writing you this email to seek your cooperation and
partnership in a business that would benefit us immensely.

I would like to name you as the beneficiary to my late client's fund who
died along with his next-of-kin during a summer vacation in the Middle
East.

I shall offer you 50 percent of the fund, and you will be in custody of
my intended investment in your country with my share.

Do reply for details.

Regards
Arthur Alan
