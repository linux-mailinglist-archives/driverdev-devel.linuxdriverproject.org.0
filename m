Hello

How are you, I hope this email finds you in good health and spirit? Before I continue let me humbly apologize for coming into your space unsolicited. Nonetheless, I take solace in the fact that it is with the best intention and for our mutual benefit.

I chose you among other contacts I came across in my search for someone who can be of help to the both of us.  It took a great deal of brain storming to arrive at my decision I must say with the hope that my contact with you is private and confidential.

The business idea that I have is to partner with you by investing in your country and you being my fund manager. This whole idea is borne out of the fact that presently I am totally indisposed to carry out any financial transaction owing to restrictions relating to the Russia /Ukraine war and the suspicious death of my husband. 

I will be an absolute pleasure, if you would have the wherewithal to handle this project and to my satisfaction. Every detail of me, where Im coming from and the urgency of this project will be layed bare to you upon your indication of interest. 

Strictly use this email address for your respons (bizzinfo11@gmail.com).


Best regards

Anna Pechorin.
