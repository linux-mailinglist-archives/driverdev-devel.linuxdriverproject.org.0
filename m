Hello



We wish to notify you that the investor's investment plan in our crypto-institution yields a huge amount of money at maturity, and we have not heard from the investor for a very long time. We received your contact information as the true owner of the fund, in our effort to contact him, we were informed that he diverted your funds, and he was sentenced to imprisonment. Our efforts to reach him have been unsuccessful, while his criminal ganags are still contacting you with endless advance fees and empty promises. We are contacting you to confirm your instructions to rollover or cash out. Please reply immediately for more details and further directives.



Kind regards,
Gali Li
Administrative Assistant
