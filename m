Dear friend,

It is with trust and sincerity that I approach you for assistance to transfer some funds into your bank account. Please accept my apology if my mail infringes on your personal ethics. My name is Barrister Ivan Dawson, a Private Lawyer based here in London, United Kingdom. Honestly it will be my humble pleasure if we can work together.

I would like you to act as the next of kin to my deceased client Mr. Franz Hoffmann, a German citizen who made a deposit of GBP25Million only with a bank here in England a few years back. He died in a plane crash with his immediate family without any registered next of kin and as such the funds now have an open beneficiary mandate with the bank. This means that any person from your country can act as the next of kin and claim the inheritance funds without any risk.

I have received an official letter from the bank suggesting a likely proceeding for confiscation of the Fund in line with existing laws by the bank in which my client deposited the sum of GBP25million. According to the Government Law as provided in section 129 sub 63(N), Bank of England Banking Edit of 1961 at the expiration of 11 years the fund will revert to the ownership of the British Government, if nobody applies to claim the fund.

My proposition to you is to present you to the bank as the Next of Kin and beneficiary of my deceased client so that the bank will pay this GBP25million to you for us to share the amount on a mutually agreed percentage of 60% for me 40% for you.

All legal documents to back up your claim as the deceased Next of Kin will be provided by me. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us to see this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

If you are interested in this transaction, Please do let me know immediately so that I can give you comprehensive details on how to proceed.  This is my private email address.

Regards,
Barrister Ivan Dawson.
