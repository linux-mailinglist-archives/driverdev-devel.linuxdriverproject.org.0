Hi!!

We invite you to take advantage of the on-going Private 
Partnership Funding PPF through our portfolio managers at the 
Dubai International Financial Center DIFC, I am a financial 
consultant and mortgage broker with over 21years experience in 
the capital market, I have a referral mandate with the 
facilitators of this provisional loan scheme and therefore, 
soliciting for SME, public and private firms who are pursuing 
capital injection for their production growth or expansion.

There are terms and conditions that qualify applicants to the 
eligibility criteria and those measures are put in place to 
ensure that subscribers to the PPF do not default on the 
repayment of the interest on the loan and to maintain a 
verifiable track record on the borrower's business operations 
upon which the PLS is granted. Should you be interested to 
participate in this offer, I would implore you to share your 
Business Plan or Executive Summary for review and if your 
business plan meets the probable consideration for the PPF, I 
shall revert to you by recommending you to these service 
providers at the DIFC.

Regards,
Mr. Mathew
