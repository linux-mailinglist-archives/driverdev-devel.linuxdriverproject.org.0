Good day.

I am the new EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR and Head of Operations of Overseas Credit Commission London, UK. Sometime ago, in
our organization your overdue consignment fund was brought to our office for final delivery clearance.

However, upon my arrival to this office, I found your consignment clearance file lying fallow on my desk without any attention. On a thorough scrutiny I discovered that your consignment have been abandoned by your delivery agent. Meanwhile, I have made several attempts to contact your delivery agent but to no avail. To my greatest surprise, during my recent routine checking, I personally discovered that your consignment content declaration documents stated that your consignment contains personal effects meanwhile, it contains United States dollar bills worth over US$ 10.5 Million dollars, which made it impossible for  the consignment to be delivered to you earlier before now.

Based on this personal discovery, I am contacting you now to let you know that with my position and power in this office, I can assist you to legally clear your consignment fund, but you must agree with the following conditions:

You must not disclose to any member of my organization whatever assistance that I am going to render to you in respect of clearing this consignment fund into your custody.

You will provide me with an authenticated promissory note, other wise known as partnership agreement, that upon the safe arrival of the consignment fund to your custody, that you give me 30% of the total fund contained in the consignment.

You must give adequate attention to this matter until we successfully and legally clear the consignment fund into your custody.

Upon your acceptance with my above conditions, I will furnish you with further details of what should be done to legally get the consignment fund cleared and delivered to you as the rightful owner of the consignment.

Meanwhile, if you know that you would be unable to keep the secret of my assistance to you in this regards, please do not border to reply.

Hence the consignment fund would be recovered into our organization treasury account as unclaimed consignment fund. Be informed that the consignment contain the sum of $10.5 million dollars in the luggage.

Let me inform you before hand that it will cost money to execute transaction of this magnitude, whatever it will cost to execute this project shall rest on both parties resources.

But if you can assure me of your competency to keep this secret, I would like to hear from you soon as possible so that I can email you further details and guidelines.

I am looking forward to your earliest response.
Have a Great Day

Mr. Peter Brook
Head of Operations
