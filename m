Partnership Request



Sir,

I am Mark Kone,a consultant and of African descent but based here in the U.K.I am contacting you after painstaking searching exercise to confirm that you have the reputation and capacity to handle the task ahead.

We are in search of a reputable person or company to do a partnership with.I am currently working for a government official who is a former Minister of Petroleum Resources in one of the biggest oil producing countries in the world.Unfortunately the country's refineries are not working so they depend very much on imported refined products.These products usually come in numerous very big vessels and the country does not have deep ports to berth such vessels in their country.Inevitably,they use smaller vessels to transfer the products from the mother- vessel from the high sea to their ports en-route Tank farms for distribution.

Now,here is the area of partnership.The ministry pays so much for the transshipment of these products hence the minister desires to get involved in a private capacity by proxy.Your role here will be to Incorporate a company and Register same with the ministry in accordance with the laid down rules of foreign companies engaging in commercial activities in their country.Once that is done,the minister will provide the necessary fund required to procure medium size vessels (7-10) in your company's name  for the contract.

However,we are proposing a 30% commission for you from what is accumulated as profit.The anticipated  monthly profit accumulation is in the region of usd 10-15m.

Please confirm your interest for further details.

Yours faithfully,
Mark Kone
