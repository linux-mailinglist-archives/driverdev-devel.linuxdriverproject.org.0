The aim of this series is to add support to the fan found on RPi's PoE
HAT. Some commentary on the design can be found below. But the imporant
part to the people CC'd here not involved with PWM is that, in order to
achieve this properly, we also have to fix the firmware interface the
driver uses to communicate with the PWM bus (and many other low level
functions). Specifically, we have to make sure the firmware interface
isn't unbound while consumers are still up. So, patch #1 introduces
reference counting in the firwmware interface driver and patches #2 to
#7 update all firmware users. Patches #8 to #10 introduce the new PWM
driver.

I sent everything as a single series as the final version of the PWM
drivers depends on the firwmare fixes, but I'll be happy to split this
into two separate series if you think it's better.

--- Original cover letter below ---

This series aims at adding support to RPi's official PoE HAT fan[1].

The HW setup is the following:

| Raspberry Pi                               | PoE HAT                    |
 arm core -> Mailbox -> RPi co-processor -> I2C -> Atmel MCU -> PWM -> FAN

The arm cores have only access to the mailbox interface, as i2c0, even if
physically accessible, is to be used solely by the co-processor
(VideoCore 4/6).

This series implements a PWM bus, and has pwm-fan sitting on top of it as per
this discussion: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/2/486. Although this design has a
series of shortcomings:

- It depends on a DT binding: it's not flexible if a new hat shows up with new
  functionality, we're not 100% sure we'll be able to expand it without
  breaking backwards compatibility. But without it we can't make use of DT
  thermal-zones, which IMO is overkill.

- We're using pwm-fan, writing a hwmon driver would, again, give us more
  flexibility, but it's not really needed at the moment.

I personally think that it's not worth the effort, it's unlikely we'll get
things right in advance. And ultimately, if the RPi people come up with
something new, we can always write a new driver/bindings from scratch (as in
not reusing previous code).

That said, I'm more than happy to change things if there is a consensus that
another design will do the trick.
