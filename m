Hello,    

My name is Ms. Reem Ebrahim Al-Hashimi, I am the "Minister of state and Petroleum" also "Minister of State for International Cooperation" in UAE.  I write to you on behalf of my other "three (3) colleagues" who has approved me to solicit for your "partnership in claiming of {us$90=Million}" from a Financial Home in Cambodia on their behalf and for our "Mutual Benefits".

The Fund {us$90=Million} is our share from the (Over-invoiced) Oil/Gas deal with Cambodian/Vietnam Government within  2013/2014, however, We don't want our government to know about the fund. If this proposal interests you, let me know, by sending me an email and I will send to you detailed information on how this business would be successfully transacted. Be informed that nobody knows about the secret of this fund except us, and we know how to carry out the entire transaction. So I am compelled to ask, that you will stand on our behalf and receive this fund into any account that is solely controlled by you.

We will compensate you with 30% of the total amount involved as gratification for being our partner in this transaction. Reply to my private email as stated: reemal-hashimi@yandex.com

Regards,
Ms. Reem Ebrahim Al-Hashimi.
