Hi Dear,

This is to notify that your over due fund which has
been delayed since years ago is now ready for payment but i don't know how i
am to explain this to you because what i was able to retrieve from the bank
is only but $459,000.00 which i don't know how i am to send these funds
across to you.

If you really need the funds valued $459,000.00, then do let me know so
i can instruct the bank to send you the money.

Hope it is safe for you to receive the funds?

Remain blessed and healthy.

Yours faithfully,
Mr. Thomas Dobbs
United Nations Payment Officer
