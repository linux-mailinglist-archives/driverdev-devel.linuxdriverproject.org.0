Please kindly allow me share this information with you,


Dear Beloved, Life is gradually passing away from me as a result of my pres=
ent medical condition, i'm battling with lung cancer and my personal doctor=
 confided in me yesterday that I have only a few more weeks to live. In vie=
w of this setback, I want to donate my estate for humanitarian assistance, =
since this has always been the plan of my late husband and besides I have n=
o child also with the current refugee crisis around the world. In an effort=
 to compliment the good work of our creator for humanity and the wish of my=
 late Husband I donate the sum of =A310,000,000.00 GBP (Ten Million GBP) to=
 you. Upon your acknowledgement of this email and informing me of your nati=
onality and current place of resident, my Bank will facilitate due processe=
s for transfer of this legacy to you. May God bless you as you use this mon=
ey judiciously for the work of charity to help the less privileged. I inten=
d for you to retain 40% of the funds for your commitment and sacrifice to m=
ake this possible. Thank you

Sincere regards, =


Ms. Melvida Bullock
