Good morning,


Our company is interested  buying Concentrated Oil in large quantities, can you supply this products from your country? Concentrated FDA Oil is a food supplement for Sub-Saharan Horses and Ponies and it  was recently found to be sold very cheap in your country than what our company buy in America, SO if you are ready to cooperate with me on this business I will give you the contact of the dealer in your country, so that you can bridge the gap between them and our company  and have the product supply direct by your companay and after we share the profit together that is my interest contact me for more details explanations.


   I awaits your response to the above discussion.



Sincerely,


John Apiah.
