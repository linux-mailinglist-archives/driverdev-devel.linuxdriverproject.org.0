Dear Friend,

I am Adrian Othonos, the Auditor General, Bank of Greece{BKG}.In the course of my auditing, I discovered a floating fund in an account, which was opened in 1999 belonging to a dead foreigner who died in 2002. Every effort made to track any member of his family or next of kin has since failed; hence I got in contact with you to stand as his next of kin since you bear the same last name with him. He died leaving no heir or a will, I will explain my intention to you only if you are interested 


Best Regards,

Adrian Othonos
