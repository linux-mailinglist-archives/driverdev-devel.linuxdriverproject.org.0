Dear Beloved

Life is gradually passing away from me as a result of my present medical
condition and my personal doctor confided in me yesterday that I have only
but few more weeks to live.

In view of this setback, I want to donate my estate for humanitarian
assistance, since this has always been the plan of my late husband and
besides I have no child.

In an effort to compliment the good work of God almighty and the wish of my
late Husband I donate the sum of $2,800,000.00 (Two Million Eight Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) to you.

On your acknowledgment of this mail and informing me of your nationality and
current place of resident, my Bank will facilitate due processes for
transfer of this legacy to you.

May God bless you as you use this money judiciously for the work of charity.

Sincere regards,

Mrs.verenich ekaterina
