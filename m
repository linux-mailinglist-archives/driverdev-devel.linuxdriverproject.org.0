I am writing you to manage my funds I received as financial gratification from various foreign companies I assisted to receive participation slot in the incoming Dubai World Expo 2020. 

The amount is $44,762,906.00 United States dollars.The cumulative deposit were given as an expression of appreciation from the various foreign companies whose applications received approval to participate in the in-coming Dubai Expo 2020. But I could not receive the various gratifications to my personal account in my country because my social status as a married Muslim lady with limitations to certain investment opportunities. 
 
For this reason, an agreement was reached with a consulting firm to keep the funds in open beneficiary account with a financial institution where it will be possible to instruct transfer of the funds to a third party account for investment purpose which is the reason I am contacting you to receive and manage the funds as my investment partner. 

The detail will be discuss on your indication of interest with your information and capacity to manage the fund.

However, if you are not ready to take up responsibility in this partnership, do not reply to this message.
 
Wishing you the best in the month.
