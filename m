Yeah, that's the possible case although most calls are fine with it
since the limit is PAGE_SIZE or so.  This might need a bit more
special care.

Bah, I'm afraid that I overlooked this point!

I've scraped over many places via a script-like work, and did the
compile testing of the kernel, but not about tools.  If that's the
