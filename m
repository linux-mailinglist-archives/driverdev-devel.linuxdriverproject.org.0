Greetings,

My name is Roitman Shvartsman, a Russian origin.I closed my Business in
Russia because of Financial Sanctions on Russia from making bank wire
transfers to all over Europe, America and Asia due to Russia military
invasion on Ukraine.

However before the sanction I had pulled all my money in cash from my
banks in Russia to London and Turkey and I want you to help me and
receive the money from the safe keeping place.You will be entitled to
a certain percentage of the total sum for your help, and another
percentage of profit accruing from funds on investments as your share
benefits.

Hope this will meet you in good health and Condition. Please contact me 
for
more detail if interested. Reply to; ( Roitman.shvartsman@hotmail.com )

I look forward to your reply for further details ASAP.

Yours truly,
Mr.Roitman shvartsman
