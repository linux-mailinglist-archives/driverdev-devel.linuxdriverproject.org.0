Dear friend,

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

I wish to notify you that your last name were listed as a beneficiary
to a deceased customer of our bank.

I contacted you because you bear the surname identity and therefore
can present you as the beneficiary to the inheritance. I therefore
reckoned that you could receive these funds as you are qualified by
your name identity. All the legal papers will be processed in your
acceptance.

Mr. Timothy D. Foreman
Chief Financial Officer Axiom Bank.
