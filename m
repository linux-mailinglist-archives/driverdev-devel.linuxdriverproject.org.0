Attn: Email beneficiary,


COVID-19 RELIEF FUND DONATION.

You have been awarded the sum of US$2,000,000 (Two Million US Dollars) as
Covid-19 Economic Devastation Relief Package.

The COVID-19 pandemic marks an unprecedented time in modern history that
will require the best of humanity to overcome. Our Global Donation will
support immediate and long-term relief and recovery to vulnerable
individuals, businesses and communities during one of the most challenging
times we have collectively faced. The crisis has brought so many
businesses, companies and small scale businesses to a devastating halt. It
has threatened everyone's way of life, but it is especially difficult for
people who are already vulnerable. Some people around the globe,
especially migrants, wage workers, and those with flexible jobs and small
scale businesses have already started feeling the devastating economic
impact.

We have received Billions of Dollars from Donors to help in this poverty
alleviation program. This money is expected to be shared to all the
Selected Global Citizenry to help them regain the Economic Losses of
Multiple Global Lockdowns since the beginning of this Pandemic. We have
worked and will continue working with our partners on the ground to
allocate funds where they're most needed. We believe that organizations
that are deeply rooted are best positioned to lead long-term plans to stop
the spread of COVID-19 and the devastating economic effect of the Global
Lock-downs.

Our funds have been delivered down to our distribution points and
currently secured by the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) Vault
Operations, Centurion, South Africa, as you can see on the following
Web-video page:

Our Payment Administrator will help processing and releasing to you the
sum of US$2, 000,000 (Two Million United States Dollars) to enable you
boost your business, stabilize your region, help the vulnerable and
less-privileged around you, and help stop the spread of Covid-19.

Kindly contact the payment administrator to his email:
jabufk@highveldmail.co.za (Mr. Jabu Fisani Agbanu).  Ensure to provide him
with your following
 information:

1. Your full names.
2. Your address.
3. Your telephone.
4. Your age.
5. Your occupation.
6. Your bank account information


We thank you, and congratulations from Relief International Post-Pandemic
Economic Relief Fund!

Yours truly,



Dr.  Patrick Wiz
(Secretary; Relief International Charity Foundation Incorporated)
