Dear Friend

  This is to thank you for your effort. I understand that your hands were
  tied. Not to worry. I have succeeded, the money has been transferred into the
  account provided by a newly found friend of mine in Russia to compensate for
  your past assistance and commitments, I have dropped an international
  certified bank draft of $1.2M for your investments in life-settlement. I am
  in Russia with my family presently. I do intend to establish some business
  concerns here, and possibly buy some properties. Now Contact my secretary Mr
  Will Clark  on his email willclark629@gmail.com phone 7052187354 Forward
  your mailing address/phone fax number to him, then ask him to send the
  cheque to you.

  Take good care of your self.


  Regards and respect,
  Pascal Simon
