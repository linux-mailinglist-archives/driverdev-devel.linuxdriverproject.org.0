Head Officer-in-Charge
Administrative Service Inspection Unit
Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport
Atlanta, Georgia.USA

I am Andrew Robert, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service
Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson
International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I
discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United
Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility
here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of
money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 45Lbs each. The
consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly
declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal
effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping
Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's
inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the
reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.

By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more.They
are still left in the airport storage facility till today. The
Consignments like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about
45Lbs each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective
capacity: 110 LBS.) Approximately.The details of the consignment
including your name and email on the official document from United
Nation's office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal
effects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands
now, you have to reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, full address
so I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the
official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need
the consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK (place of
origin)as we were instructed.

As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most
importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for
the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection
document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to
get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of
it (financial gratification). You can either come in person or you
engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that
will provide the necessary security that is required to deliver the
package to your doorstep or the destination of your choice. I need all
the guarantee that I can get from you before I can get involved in
this project.Please Reply this email strictly at (anbrandn@daum.net)
with reconfirmation of your Full Name, Home Address, City, State and
Telephone number.

Best Regards,
