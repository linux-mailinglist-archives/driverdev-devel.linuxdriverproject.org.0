Season Greeting,

I need a trusted person who can invest my client fund.

I have investor who wishes to re-invest their funds by putting it into the management of private businessmen and corporations with good business ideas that can generate at least 10% ROI per Annul over a maximum of 5years duration.

My Client has offered some terms which will be discussed when you show interest and make appointment for meeting to know more and understanding,

Sincerely,

Mr James Witherspoon
