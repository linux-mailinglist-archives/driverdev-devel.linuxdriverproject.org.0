Dear Sir, Madam,
 

Confidential Business Proposal

 
I am Mr.John Woods, a Consultant with the Department of Power and Steel here in Spain . I have been contracted by a wealthy individual and serving  government official from somewhere in Africa who is interested in  engaging your services for investment of a large volume of fund (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ) Which he Deposited with a Finance Company here in Spain . You will act as the beneficiary of the fund to carry out the investment of the fund in any business venture you consider lucrative.

If you are capable of handling any type of investment in your country, Please, get back to me immediately and send your telephone and fax numbers to enable me communicate with you and provide you with further details.

Note that 30% of the fund is your share (Commission) for securing the fund from the security company before the investment of the fund shall be carried out. This is necessary because the investor as a serving government official in his country of origin is eager to transfer ownership of the fund to you because he is not expected in his official capacity to own such huge sum of money.

I will appreciate an urgent response from you.

Yours faithfully,

Mr.John Woods
