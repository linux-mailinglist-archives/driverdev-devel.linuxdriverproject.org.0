Dear Friend


I am sorry to encroach into your privacy in this manner my name is Morgan Johnson an American soldier serving in Afghanistan my reason for contacting you is that i would want to confide in you that i have in my possession the sum of $4,980,000.00USD (Four million Nine hundred and eighty thousand American Dollars)the above sum was given to me as my share after a raid and to conceal this amount of money became a problem for me. I am ready to compensate you with 40% of the funds the only thing i require from you is for you to help me receive this funds once i move the money out of Afghanistan because i am in a war zone. I have already mapped out strategy to move the money out of Afghanistan to your location with the aid of the diplomat and the diplomat certainly does not know the real contents of the consignments and he believes that it belongs to a Late Franco-American soldier Spc.Aguila Francisco Xavier who was attacked and killed by enemy with small arms fire and before giving up he 
 trusted me to hand over the package to his family.


With my present arrangement/procedure to evacuate this money out of here i am very positive that within two weeks it will get to your location. I shall provide you with the full details as soon as i receive your response. Right now i am very careful with the way i communicate so as to reduce any kind of risk until this money is finally in your custody. I will be communicating with you through email alone because our phone conversation might be monitored by unit bugs,i am doing this on trust and so i would want you to put aside any act of greed as we have a lot to gain in this project.Can I trust you? When you receive this message please kindly send me an e-mail signifying your interest.



Respectfully,
Captain Morgan Johnson
