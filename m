How are you today? I Hope you are staying safe,

I am  Mr Aleksandr Kovalenko from Ukraine, and I am an investor and real estate developer. I am looking for a possible tie-up with a business partnership or individual in your country. I want to invest my money there as my country's economy has been ravaged by the Russian invasion which no one knows when the war will end.

I have Ten Million five Hundred Thousand Dollars.($10,500,000.00) to invest in any good business in your country.

My Wife and Daughter have crossed to Poland for refugee, I am still in my country Ukraine as our President do not allow men to cross the border, we were asked to stay back and defend our country,

I have move the funds to Poland through a help of a Security Company firm from Ukraine, please I will need your help to receive the money and invest it in a good business and thereafter you take my Wife and Daughter out from Poland to your country and take good care of them as I'm presently in a war zone which I don't know when I will be free, most importantly I want you to take good care of my family.

There are no economic activities going on again in Ukraine since the Russian invasion started. Looking forward to your sincere reply, and I will send more information on what to do next.

Please I need your urgent reply to this email above.
Best Regard,
Mr Aleksandr Kovalenko
