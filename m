Hello,

How are you doing?

Please do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your
ethics, I am Doug Macpherson an external auditor of a reputable bank. In
one of our periodic audits, I discovered a dormant account, which has
not been operated for the past Five years. From my investigations and
confirmations, the owner of this account is a foreigner who died long
ago and since then nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of
this money because he has no family members who are aware of the
existence of neither the account nor the funds. I have secretly
discussed this matter with a top senior official here and we have agreed
to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with us although due to his
position he did not want to take an active part but as soon as you
follow my instructions everything will be successful because we
will be working hand in hand with him. With this purpose to do business
with you, standing in as the next of kin of these funds from the
deceased and after due legal processes have been followed the fund will
be released to your account without delay and we will use it for
investment and to assist the less privileged in the societies because if
we left the fund with the government it will be fortified for
nothing and will be used to suppress the poor masses in the society.

On receipt of your response, I will furnish you with more details as it
relates to this mutual benefit transaction. Do contact me immediately
whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will
enable me to scout for another foreign Partner to carry out this deal.
But where you are interested, contact me URGENTLY for more details as
time is of the essence in this business.


Best Regards,

Doug Macpherson
