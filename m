Sir/Madam


I am Mrs. Marina Luda, I am a US citizen, 52 years Old. I reside here in Florida USA. My residential address is as follows, 7008 E Hwy 326 Silver Springs Florida 34488 United States, am thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that took part in the compensation in West Africa (Nigeria) many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $85,000 while trying to get my payment all to no avail.

So I decided to travel to Washington with all my compensation documents, And I was directed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation Director to contact Mr.James Douglas, who is a representative of the INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF) and a member of the Compensation Award Committee, I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake.

He took me to the paying bank for the claim of my compensation payment. Right now I can't even sleep,I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $12.5 Million US Dollars. Moreover, Mr. James Douglas showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email as one of the beneficiaries on the list he showed me, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, 

they are only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact Mr. Jame Douglas. Kindly send your personal details to him to prove your identification.

Full Name:
Home Address:
Occupation:
Phone Number:
Age:
Gender:
country:

You have to contact him directly on this information below.

Compensation Award Office.
Name : Mr. James Douglas
Email: jamesddouglas01@gmail.com

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and  will dry you up until you have nothing. The only money I paid after I met Mr. Jame Douglas was just $425 USD for the paper works, take note of that.

Once again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact Mr. Jame Douglas so that he can help you to receive your fund instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank you and be Blessed.



Mrs. Marina Luda
