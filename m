Hello ,


My name is Ramsey Taylor. I work as a procurement assistant. I got your contact details in my search for a reliable and neutral company or individual to partner with in the area of investment. I need your assistance to manage an investment fund in a profitable business in your region with good Annual Return on Investment (AROI). I know that this mail might come to you as a surprise because we neither know each other nor have ever met but please accept it with an open and positive mind.


Details of the investment and funding will be furnished to you when I receive your response which will also facilitate a face to face meeting with the investors.


Waiting for your quick response.
 Email: abs0000200@gmail.com

Yours sincerely,

Ramsey Taylor
