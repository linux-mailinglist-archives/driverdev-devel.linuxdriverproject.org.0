If this message intrude into your privacy or cause you any inconvenience, I sincerely apologize as that's not the intended
purpose.

I am one of the senior staff of Emirates Development Bank, here in ABU DHABI, UAE. We have an amount of money to the tune of five hundred million United State dollars (US $500,000.000.) only, floating in our Bank that we can re-profile for our mutual benefit, if you agree to cooperate with me. This is just between You and me, and we can split the fund in the ratio of 50/50%, as I do not want to be greedy. You will be the recipient and I will show you how we can execute the transaction
successfully. There is no risk involved and it will be a hitch-free transaction.

If you want to work with me, kindly indicate your interest to do so and I will give you the details. This is strictly Confidential and must not be disclosed to a third party please. For further correspondence, Kindly get back to me.

My Regards,

Abdul Al Fahim
