Dear Friend,

My name is Capt.

On January 1, 2018. during our rescue mission assignment for a Jordanian Pilot (hostage) at ISIS Oil Facility, there was a particularly brutal firefight in Raqqa, ISIS’s capital in Syria, after defeating them, i came across a two crest box that contain huge amount of money that belongs to the sponsors and supporter of ISIS, which i believe that the money was meant for buying of weapons and ammunition's, so we agreed by 9 Army officer on that rescue mission that the money will be enclosed and be shared among all of us.

After we shared the money, i got a share of $ 2,500.000.00 ( Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars),

I am soliciting on you to keep it safe on my behalf till i come over to your country, It's clear to me that you might be scared of this proposal, but i want to let you know that i have made solid arrangements with a Security Cargo Company that specialize on diplomatic delivery and they have promised to deliver the fund through diplomatic method to any of my choosing destination.

Below is the delivery company address.

Phone: +971 1557 4687 98

I have decide to compensate you with 40% of the total money once after the money is delivered to you, while the rest balance shall be my investment capital in your country wish you will assist me.
