Dear Sir,

My name is Dr. MRS LINDY WHITE an Investment Attorney with a reputable legal & investment management firm. My Firm mostly represents the interests of wealthy investors.

Due to the sensitivity of the position they hold in their society and the unstable investment environment of their country, some of our Clients evacuate the majority of their funds into more stable economies and developed nations where they can get good yield for their money.

A Reserved Client, whom I had personally worked with a few years ago with a proposal, recently approached me. What he requests is an individual such as you, who will be willing to receive money on his behalf, and put it to good use for a period not exceeding 6 years for a start.

The Client has offered some terms which will be discussed when you show interest, and reply to this mail.

Sincerely,
MRS LINDY WHITE
