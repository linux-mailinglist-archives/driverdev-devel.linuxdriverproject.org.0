While in the process of preparing vchiq to support the Raspberry Pi 4, I
stumbled upon a bunch of dead code in it. Which this series deletes.

Ultimately the idea is to clean up vchiq_bcm2835_arm.c up to a point
where it'll be easy to join it with vchiq_arm.c, which IIRC the TODO
file states, should be the sole responsible for platform code.

With this we'll be able to introduce RPi4's functionality in a cleaner
way.

Overall it's a 500 line clean up, I tried to keep the patches as small and
manageable as possible, but I'd be happy to squash them if you prefer it
that way.

This was tested on a RPi3-B using the camera and HDMI audio and
vchiq_test app.
