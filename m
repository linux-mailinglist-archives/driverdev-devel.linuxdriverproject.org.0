Hello,

We are very sorry  to communicate  you through this medium. we
are  member of the European Debt Recovery Unit and we are aware
of your ordeals and challenges of your unpaid fund.

It might interest you to know that not long after the Debt
Management Office (DMO) completed the merger and acquisition
process of all pending payments, through the petitions submitted
by the international communities about their unpaid funds,
however in the course of our examination and fact findings as
stated in the petitions We discovered that one of the top
personnel in the management compromised with some top officials
to divert funds approves to settle unpaid Fund (concealed funds).

The DMO has already given approval for the payment of your fund
but they deliberately withheld your payment file and continue to
demand fees from you through their associates from different
unassigned affiliates mostly from Africa, US, Europe, and Asia
all in an attempt to frustrate you and enrich themselves. I
wonder why you haven't noticed all this while.

You may choose to disbelieve this email as inconceivable but my
doctrine does not permit such an act, the reason I have to open
up to you to seek the right channel. Your fund was authorized to
be paid to you through the DMO asset management firm with a Key
Tested Reference/Claim Code Number, which was supposed to have
been issued to you before now.

Upon your response to my message, I shall guide you through and
provide you with details to contact the assigned affiliate who
will facilitate the release of your fund.

Thanks and have a wonderful day.

Yours Faithfully,

 Andrew Hansen,
European Debt Recovery Agent, UK
