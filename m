Hello

I trust you are well, I am Cliff, a friend and business partner 
in the making. My reason for contacting you is to introduce a 
business proposal to you which will be beneficial for both of us. 
I want you to stand as my business partner in your country to 
receive sum funds from me for investment purposes in your 
country.

For introduction; I am a security adviser to a government 
official in-charge of the contracts awards department in my 
country. 

We have the sum of USD45, 000.000.00 over-invoiced which I would 
like to transfer into your country for investment through your 
assistant.

Kindly reply to my mail, as soon as I hear from you, I will let 
you know full details of the transaction.

 

Yours sincerely.
