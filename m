How are you today? I Hope you are staying safe,
 
I am  Mr Aleksandr Kovalenko from Ukraine, and I am an investor 
and real estate developer. I am looking for a possible tie-up 
with a business or individual in your country so that I can do 
some investments there as my country's economy has been ravaged 
by the Russian invasion which no one knows when it will come to 
an end.
 
I have Ten Million five Hundred Thousand Dollars.($10,500,000.00) 
to invest in any good business in your country.
 
My family Wife and Daughter have crossed to Poland for refugee, I 
am still in my country Ukraine as they do not allow men to cross 
the border, we were asked to stay back and defend my country,
 
I have move the funds to Poland through a help of a Security 
Company from Ukraine, please I will like you to receive this Fund 
and invest it in a good business and thereafter you take my Wife 
and Daughter out from Poland to your country and take good care 
of them as am in a war zone which I don't know when this war will 
end, most importantly I want you to take good care of my family.
 
There are no economic activities going on again in Ukraine since 
the Russian invasion started. Looking forward to your sincere 
reply.
 
Best Regard,
Mr Aleksandr Kovalenko
