-- 
My name is Reem E. Al-Hashimi, the Emirates Minister of State and 
Managing Director of United Arab Emirates (Dubai) World Expo 2020 
Committee. I am writing you to stand as my partner to receive my share 
of gratification from foreign companies whom I helped during the bidding 
exercise towards the Dubai World Expo 2020 Committee and also i want to 
use this funds assist Corona virus Symptoms and Causes.

Am a single Arab women and serving as a minister, there is a limit to my 
personal income and investment level and  For this reason, I cannot 
receive such a huge sum back to my country or my personal account, so an 
agreement was reached with the foreign companies to direct the 
gratifications to an open beneficiary account with a financial 
institution where it will be possible for me to instruct further 
transfer of the fund to a third party account for investment purpose 
which is the reason i contacted you to receive the fund as my partner 
for investment in your country.

The amount is valued at Euro 47,745,533.00 with a financial institution 
waiting my instruction for further transfer to a destination account as 
soon as I have your information indicating interest to receive and 
invest the fund, I will compensate you with 30% of the total amount and 
you will also get benefit from the investment.

If you can handle the fund in a good investment. reply on this email 
only: reemalhashimi@daum.net
Regards,
Ms. Reem
