Hello Dear,
We at Calin Capital Group recognize the impact and the challenges the 
covid19 pandemic has had on both corporate and SME enterprises, and 
therefore have developed programs and investor engagements that would 
not only help identify these gaps but also manage and create better 
business expectations.

We have opportunities to attract viable investments to your business 
through our pool of financial investors, and for a chance to be 
considered for funding, kindly provide us your project brief or an 
executive summary for our review.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours Sincerely,

Lewis Anderson
Client Project Manager | CPM
CALIN CAPITAL
